theory:
List
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Create a List:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Ordered
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.

Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Allow Duplicates
Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Lists allow duplicate values:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)


Tuple
Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

Tuples are written with round brackets.

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Create a Tuple:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
Tuple Items
Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.

Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

Ordered
When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unchangeable
Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

Allow Duplicates
Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Tuples allow duplicate values:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
